## PCA and Advanced Clustering Techniques

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning. It helps to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. The fundamental idea behind PCA is to transform the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal components, which capture the maximum variance in the data.

### Key points about PCA:

- Variance Maximization: PCA aims to find the directions (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized. The first principal component accounts for the most significant variance, the second for the second most, and so on.
- Orthogonality: The principal components are orthogonal, meaning they are uncorrelated. This simplifies the interpretation of the transformed data.
- Dimensionality Reduction: By selecting a subset of the most important principal components, PCA allows for effective dimensionality reduction. This is particularly useful when working with high-dimensional datasets.

### Mixed Data Clustering Project
- This project explores the application of clustering algorithms to datasets containing a mix of numerical and categorical features. The analysis is conducted using popular clustering techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), DBSCAN, and K-prototypes. Additionally, the Gower distance metric is introduced for handling mixed-type data.

#### Datasets: 
Iris Dataset
- The well-known Iris dataset is employed to demonstrate clustering on numerical features. Various clustering methods, including GMM and DBSCAN, are applied to uncover patterns within the data.

Fruits Dataset
- A dataset featuring both numerical and categorical features, representing attributes of different fruits, is utilized. Clustering is performed using GMM and DBSCAN to identify natural groupings within the dataset.

College Dataset
- A more complex dataset representing statistics of US colleges is used, featuring a mix of continuous and categorical features. K-prototypes clustering is applied to uncover meaningful patterns and groupings among the colleges.

#### Tools and Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, K-prototypes, Gower Distance, Seaborn, Matplotlib

#### How to Use
- Install the required dependencies using pip install package.
- Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks to understand the clustering process on mixed-type data.
- Experiment with different clustering algorithms and datasets to gain insights into their behavior.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or use the code for your own clustering projects involving mixed data types. Happy clustering!
